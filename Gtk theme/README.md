# About
Modified version of [Sweet](https://github.com/EliverLara/Sweet).

Not only the colors were modified, but all colors of the css is being modified to a few variables calls, to facilitate the change of colors.

## To-do

* Finish the color-to-variables transition
* Test on others systems.
   - This is only tested on Manjaro Deepin, so i cannot tell you if there is any bugs on other systems.
* Updates to newest Sweet (may be never done, a lot of rework)
